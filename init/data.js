I’ve found that many people fall into this trap at the expense of their happiness and integrity, robbing themselves and the world of a sense of deeper meaning only they can contribute by pursuing someone else's vague definition of success. Some principles I’ve found useful for getting out of the trap based on my personal values:Focus on giving over getting, becoming over achieving, understanding over being right, learning over getting the diploma, building something new over capitalizing on what others have built, investing for the long term over exploiting for the short term.",

And it has me thinking: Do I wake up “with a very thankful heart?” Or is this another one of those times as a parent where the books we hope to influence our children do not seem to pierce our callous heart? I’ll admit, this is a bit melodramatic. One of my family values is “gratitude.” I am passionate about the power of gratitude from both a biblical and psychological perspective. At my best gratitude is even part of my daily liturgy and routine. However, that’s not every day. So here I am, back to reading that line with my son and I feel a sense of resolve to create a resource for myself to come back to.The list of Bible verses below is a compilation meant to be read and prayed through as you seek to ground your day in gratitude. I hope this is useful to you, especially as we walk into this Thanksgiving week!",

We will help you get there: our first two months of sermons are entirely directed toward the subject of purpose!I’ve been part of many dialogues between Christians and Atheists, which often circle around whether everything (including humanity) was intelligently created. In essence, does humanity have a God-given purpose? Or are we merely an accident of the universe’s own chaotic doing? The question, however, has far-reaching implications, especially when it comes to love.",

To be purposefully redundant, the “therefore” links the imperative to the indicative; it links the call to action with the truth that has already been substantiated. So, where is the indicative? Where is that truth that is grounding this ethical call to action? Unsurprisingly, it is contained within the passage that came just prior.You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. 8 But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.  Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices",

        breef: "We are not talking about “spiritual” as some nebulous, impersonal energy. Rather, spiritual gifts come exclusively from the Holy Spirit. He is the source and sustenance of spiritual gifts. Having the Holy Spirit is a necessary prerequisite to unleashing our spiritual gifts.Each of us is purposed to make a contribution in this life that echoes into eternity. This means that we each have an assignment, and we each need to see and accept that assignment if we are going to fulfill the calling of our lives. You and I can talk circles around purpose all day, but at the end of the day there is something crucial to understand There is unity in our singular purpose to glorify God and enjoy him forever (shoutout to the credible Westminster Catechism). We are teammates, working together to enact God’s plan of redemption in the world. Yet, we are unique in our calling. Our calling is the unique way in which God has wired us, equipped us, and assigned us to contribute to and advance his kingdom. This is not limited to our spiritual gifts, but it certainly includes them! And even in 1 Corinthians 12, Paul is not exhausting all the spiritual gifts, but using a few as an example to serve his point about how the body of Christ (you, me, we) works together.",
